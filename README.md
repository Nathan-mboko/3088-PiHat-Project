We are designing an Uninterruptible Power supply microHAT that will be attached to a Raspberry Pi
Zero board. The main uses of our UPS is to act as back-up power source when the main power
source is unavailable, it can also act as a protective measure to prevent the Raspberry Pi Zero from
suddenly shutting down during power surges and lastly it can also be used as power bank for Raspberry
Pi board in portable devices like Cameras or mobile routers.

Instructions to use:

- connect to 230V supply
- keep out of reach of children
